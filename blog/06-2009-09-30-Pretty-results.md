Pretty results
==============

In the [results I so proudly presented][04] I always reacted to the very black corners. I initially feared that this was due to some central mistake in my whole architecture, but happily it turned out to be just a small factor of ten-mistake in the size of my hemicubes. This goes to show two things:

 * The maths on which radiosity is based is sound. As long as I try to do this correctly, it will work
 
 * This kind of bugs is what I get for building my code with duct tape rather than what I know to be the good methods

Let's move on to the new and more beautiful results! I feel that these results exhibit the wanted warmth of radiosity rendering.

Detail of the corner under the lamp. Notice that it is darker in the corner and how natural this feels.


Detail: Floor

I have no idea why this pattern appears on the floor. Time to check that duct tape.


Detail: Wall
------------

Another pattern appears on the walls opposing the lamp. Another reason to check that tape.


Fly through
-----------

And finally another fly through. This time I use the Wii remote interface for controlling. (That was something I added when I needed a break with something fun to do :)
