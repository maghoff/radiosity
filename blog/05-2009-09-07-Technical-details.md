Technical details
=================

A couple of small new things:

The [source code][source] is now hosted at [bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/), rather than [freehg.org](http://freehg.org/), which was not up to the task.

Contrary to what I [announced in the beginning][01], the blog is now hosted at [blogspot.com](http://magradiosity.blogspot.com/). I have however not abandoned my roots -- I still write the blog as Markdown-files in my project. In addition it is published to blogspot.com thanks to [my Blogger-integration scripts][integ] using [Google's Data API][gdata]. The latest features are updates of posts that have already been published and transparent linking between blog posts. This makes for a very good transparent cross-publishing experience.

That concludes this installment of meta-blogging.
